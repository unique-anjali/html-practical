    <h1>What is Mindset and why it matters?</h1>
    <p id="para1"> Your mindset is a set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself. It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any given situation.</p>
    <p id="para 2"> According to Dweck, there are two basic mindsets: fixed and growth. If you have a fixed mindset, you believe your abilities are fixed traits and therefore can't be changed. You may also believe that your talent and intelligence alone leads to success, and effort is not required.</p>

    <div>"I've seen so many people with this one consuming goal<br>
         of proving themselves in the classroom, in their careers,<br>
          and in their relationships.<br>
           Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality,<br>
            or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail?<br>
             Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? <br>
             Will I feel like a winner or a loser?"<br>
